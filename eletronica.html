                    <p>Once upon a younger year
                        When all our shadows disappeared
                        The animals inside came out to play
                        Went face to face with all our fears
                        Learned our lessons through the tears
                        Made memories we knew would never fade
                        One day, my father, he told me, "Son, don't let it slip away"
                        He took me in his arms, I heard him say
                        "When you get older your wild heart will live for younger days
                        Think of me if ever you're afraid"
                        He said, "One day, you'll leave this world behind
                        So live a life you will remember"
                        My father told me when I was just a child
                        "These are the nights that never die"
                        My father told me
                        "When thunderclouds start pouring down
                        Light a fire they can't put out
                        Carve your name into those shining stars"
                        He said, "Go venture far beyond the shores
                        Don't forsake this life of yours
                        I'll guide you home no matter where you are"
                        One day, my father, he told me, "Son, don't let it slip away"
                        When I was just a kid, I heard him say
