                    <p> One, one, one, one, one
                        Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
                        (Out of my mind, out of my mind)
                        Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
                        (Too many times, too many times)
                        My love
                        He makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
                        But my love
                        He doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
                        One: Don't pick up the phone
                        You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
                        Two: Don't let him in, you'll have to kick him out again
                        Three: Don't be his friend
                        You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
                        And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
                        I got new rules, I count 'em
                        I got new rules, I count 'em
                        I gotta tell them to myself
                        I got new rules, I count 'em
                        I gotta tell them to myself
                        I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
                        (Nowhere to turn) no way
                        (Nowhere to turn) no
                        Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
                        (I never learn, I never learn)
                        But my love (love)
                        He doesn't love me, so I tell myself
                        I tell myself, I do, I do, I do
                        One: Don't pick up the phone
                        You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
                        Two: Don't let him in, you have to kick him out again
                        Three: Don't be his friend
                        You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
                        And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
                        I got new rules, I count 'em
                        I got new rules, I count 'em
                        I gotta tell them to myself
                        I got new rules, I count 'em
                        I gotta tell them to myself
                        Practice makes perfect, I'm still tryna learn it by heart (I got new rules, I count 'em)
                        Eat, sleep and breathe it, rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I (I got new, I got new, I...)
                        One: Don't pick up the phone (yeah)
                        You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone (alone)
                        Two: Don't let him in, you have to kick him out again (again)
                        Three: Don't be his friend
                        You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin' (bed in the mornin')
                        And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
                        I got new rules, I count 'em
                        I got new rules, I count 'em
                        (Whoa-ooh, whoa-ooh, whoa)
                        I gotta tell them to myself
                        I got new rules, I count 'em
                        (Baby, you know I count 'em)
                        I gotta tell them to myself
                        Don't let him in, don't let him in, don't, don't, don't, don't
                        Don't be his friend, don't be his friend, don't, don't, don't, don't
                        Don't let him in, don't let him in, don't, don't, don't, don't
                        Don't be his friend, don't be his friend, don't, don't, don't

                        I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
                        Why don't we leave it at that?
                        Nothin' to say
                        When everything gets in the way
                        Seems you cannot be replaced
